Group Member Names: Sal, Claudia

* When are group members available to work together? What hours can each group member work individually? Are there any personal time commitments that need to be discussed?
Claudia: Very open. Cutoff on Friday at 7:00, sleep in a little bit on the weekends.
Sal: Very open. Cutoff 6:00 on Saturday.

* How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?
In person, on slack.
Written feedback after the first day or two and then also at the end.

* Which feature(s) does each group member want to work on? Which feature(s) does each group member not want to work on?
We are both planning on doing the full project and will work on each feature. However, will work together a lot on the project to have ability to ask questions and think through things together.
Decide on minitest/rspec later.

* What does each group member hope to get out of the project?
Sal: stronger in testing. Better understanding of authorization/authentication. Opportunity to break up a problem into components.
Claudia: understand project process from the beginning to the end (bringing it all together), and each of the components. Also: styling - want to get more comfortable. Get more comfortable in using Waffle.

* What is the agreed upon Git workflow? What project management tool will be used? What is the agreed upon procedure for conducting code reviews before merging into master: who will review pull requests, and when?
Git workflow for this project will be for each member to have their own repo, and branches, make the other person a collaborator. The collaborator is responsible for merging to master.
Each member will have their own Waffles repo, but will review together.

* What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature?
Try to figure it out together. Each team member is responsible for deciding how long they want to tinker before reaching.

* How does each group member want feedback (both positive and constructive) to be delivered?
See above. Claudia: pretty open about things that she doesn't like. Preferably in person.

* Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles?
Not at this point. Claudia: sometimes translating from German and may not come across as nice as she intends.
